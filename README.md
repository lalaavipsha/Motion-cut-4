This is a Kanban Board the same as you have in JIRA, Monday, and Trello. I have added a beautiful drag-and-drop feature using React, Socket.io, and React Beautiful DND. Users will be able to sign in, create and update various tasks, and add comments. The comments section serves as the task description as well! One can add the task description as well as their views about the task in this section.

3. **Effective Prioritization:** Kanban boards help prioritize tasks, ensuring that the most important work is addressed first.

4. **Real-Time Updates:** Team members have real-time access to task status, promoting transparency and collaboration.

5. **Flexibility:** Kanban is adaptable to changing project requirements, allowing teams to adjust their tasks and priorities as needed.
